Text and code are readable against the dark background, and whitespace is used effectively to separate sections. However, the animation panel is relatively small, limiting the visibility of dynamic elements, and the pseudocode block could benefit from slightly larger font for better readability.\"\n},\n\"attractiveness\": {\n    \"score\": 14,\n    \"feedback\": \"The dark color scheme (black background, white text, yellow highlights) is functional for code-focused content, but it lacks visual variety. The animation is minimal (simple dp array updates) and does not use creative metaphors or engaging effects, which may reduce learner engagement. The design is professional but not particularly modern or stimulating.\"\n},\n\"logic_flow\": {\n    \"score\": 15,\n    \"feedback\": \"The video follows a basic structure (introduction → code → variables → result) but lacks a clear pedagogical progression. It jumps into pseudocode without explaining the core concept of 'binary trees with factors' or the algorithm's rationale (e.g., why sorting is necessary, what dp[i] represents). Transitions between sections are abrupt, and pacing is too fast for beginners, as key steps (e.g., the factor check) are not visually emphasized or explained in context.\"\n},\n\"accuracy_depth\": {\n    \"score\": 17,\n    \"feedback\": \"The pseudocode and result (3 mod 1e9+7) are factually correct for the 'Binary Trees With Factors' problem. The code covers key steps (sorting, dp array initialization, factor checks). However, the depth is limited: critical concepts (e.g., dynamic programming state definition, modulo arithmetic purpose) are not explained, and examples are absent. The content aligns with the learning objective but fails to provide conceptual depth for understanding.\"\n},\n\"visual_consistency\": {\n    \"score\": 18,\n    \"feedback\": \"The visual style is highly consistent: uniform dark background, white text, yellow code highlights, and a simple animation style. Typography (font, size) is consistent across all static elements, and the animation (dp array updates) integrates smoothly with the static content. No abrupt changes in color, layout, or animation timing disrupt the coherence.\"\n},\n\"overall_score\": 81,\n\"summary\": \"The video effectively presents the technical solution to 'Binary Trees With Factors' with clear layout and consistent visuals, but it struggles with pedagogical flow and engagement. The code is accurate, but the lack of conceptual explanation and minimal animation limit its educational value for learners needing deeper understanding.\",\n\"strengths\": [\n    \"Clear, organized layout that separates code, variables, and results\",\n    \"Consistent visual style (dark theme, uniform typography)\",\n    \"Accurate pseudocode and result for the target problem\",\n    \"Simple animation that supports code execution tracking\"\n],\n\"improvements\": [\n    \"Add a conceptual introduction to explain what 'binary trees with factors' are and why the algorithm works\",\n    \"Enhance animation with visual metaphors (e.g., tree structure visualization) to make the algorithm more intuitive\",\n    \"Slow pacing and emphasize key steps (e.g., factor checks, dp updates) with visual cues\",\n    \"Include examples or step-by-step walkthroughs to build conceptual depth\"\n]\n}<|end_of_box|>",
