算法附加片段（Isomorphic Strings）：

- 题目描述 (Problem Description)：
  Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic. Two strings s and t
  are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t. All occurrences
  of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the
  order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a
  character may map to itself. Example 1: Input: s = "egg", t = "add" Output: true
  Explanation: The strings s and t can be made identical by: Mapping 'e' to 'a'.
  Mapping 'g' to 'd'. Example 2: Input: s = "foo", t = "bar" Output: false
  Explanation: The strings s and t can not be made identical as 'o' needs to be
  mapped to both 'a' and 'r'. Example 3: Input: s = "paper", t = "title" Output:
  true Constraints: 1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104 t.length == s.length s and t consist
  of any valid ascii character.
